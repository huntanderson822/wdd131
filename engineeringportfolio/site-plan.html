      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this site is to showcase the professional work of
        mechanical engineer <strong>Tricity Anderson</strong>. The portfolio
        will highlight her skills, engineering projects, and accomplishments so
        potential employers and collaborators can quickly understand what she
        can do. This website will act as a polished, central place she can
        share on résumés, LinkedIn, and applications.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The primary audience includes engineering recruiters, hiring managers,
        and technical interviewers who need a clear overview of Tricity’s
        capabilities. A secondary audience includes professors, classmates, and
        industry professionals who want to see examples of her projects and
        problem-solving process. These visitors are busy and technical, so the
        content will be concise, professional, and easy to navigate.
      </p>

      <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
      <p>
        I will use JavaScript to dynamically generate and control the project
        content on the site. All project data will be stored in an
        <strong>array of objects</strong> inside an ES module
        (<code>projects.js</code>), which will be imported into the home page
        and the projects page. On the home page, JavaScript will filter and
        display a few featured projects and update a “highlight” text area about
        Tricity when the user clicks a button. On the projects page, JavaScript
        will render all project cards into the DOM and let users filter them by
        category using array methods like <code>filter</code> and
        <code>forEach</code>. The scripts will use multiple functions, DOM
        selection and modification, event listeners, and conditional branching
        (for example, showing a “no projects found” message or styling recent
        projects differently). I will also include a simple light/dark theme
        toggle controlled with JavaScript to demonstrate additional DOM
        interaction.

      <h3>Typography</h3>

      <h4>Heading Font: Poppins, sans-serif</h4>
      <p>
        Poppins is a clean, modern font that feels technical and professional.
        It will be used for headings, navigation, and important labels.
      </p>

      <h4>Paragraph Font: Roboto, sans-serif</h4>
      <p>
        Roboto is highly readable on screens and pairs well with Poppins. It
        will be used for body text and longer project descriptions.
      </p>

      <h2>Content</h2>

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will introduce Tricity as a mechanical engineer and give a
        quick overview of who she is and what she does. It will include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A hero section with a short introduction, title (Mechanical Engineer),
          and a professional photo or engineering-related image.
        </li>
        <li>
          A brief summary of her focus areas (for example: product design,
          robotics, thermal systems) and her approach to problem solving.
        </li>
        <li>
          A “Featured Projects” section where a few key projects are displayed
          dynamically with JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          A skills snapshot listing tools and technologies such as SolidWorks,
          MATLAB, FEA, and prototyping experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          A small contact area with links to email and LinkedIn so visitors can
          reach out.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Projects page</h3>
      <p>
        The projects page will be the main portfolio area where visitors can
        browse all of Tricity’s projects and filter them by category. It will
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An introduction describing what kind of projects are shown (class
          projects, internships, personal builds, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          Filter controls (for example: “All”, “Robotics”, “CAD/Design”,
          “Thermal/Fluids”) that are connected to JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          A grid of project cards generated from the JavaScript data. Each card
          will show the project title, year, category, a short description, and
          relevant skills used.
        </li>
        <li>
          A conditional message that appears if no projects match the selected
          filter.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        Create two wireframes for your site, one for each page, and save them as
        images in the <code>images/</code> folder.
      </p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>
        The home page wireframe will show the logo and navigation at the top, a
        hero section with intro text and image, a featured projects row, a
        skills section, and a simple contact/footer area.
      </p>
      <img src="images/home-wireframe.png" alt="Home page wireframe" />

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        The projects page wireframe will show the same header and navigation, a
        short intro, filter controls near the top, and a responsive grid of
        project cards below.
